# ConsoleCoup
Console text game based on the boardgame. This consolve version is a single player against 3 computer controlled players.

Setup: Each player starts with 2 coins. Each player is dealt two cards. The players see their own cards then place them facedown so each player only has knowledge of his/her cards. 

Each card depicts a character called an Influence. An Influence allows the player to take special actions as well as blocking other players from taking certain actions. Once a player loses an Influence, it is revealed face-up.

The goal is to be the last player with Influence.
